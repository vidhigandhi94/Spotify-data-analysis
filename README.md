# Spotify-data-analysis

Spotify is one of the most popular audio streaming platforms around the globe. They have an API for developers to explore their music database and get insights into our listening habits.

To access the Spotify API, you need to login to the developer dashboard and create a client id for your own. After obtaining client id and secret id, we will use them in our python code.

𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐛𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝:

1. Songs per Artist in a specific playlist

2. Top artists by year in a specific playlist

3. Analysis of the audio features (loudness, danceability, energy, etc.) of the soundtracks present in a specific playlist

4. Finding the most similar/different songs (using vector distance)

5. Using K-means to cluster similar songs on the basis of audio features

6. Analyzing personal music trends: finding top artists and tracks (for short/mid/long term duration)
